1)Fix - yarn.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system:
Open Powershell as admin and type the following command:
>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

2)Fix -Attempted to load @next/swc-win32-x64-gnu, but it was not installed:
Delete the package-lock.json file and the node_modules directory in your project 
and then run npm install on your terminal.
3)Install heroicons:
npm install/ yarn add @heroicons/
4)/**width={20} height={20}= className="h-7" */

5)Use .env files in react:

npm install dotenv --save
*Next add the following line to your app.
require('dotenv').config()

*Then create a .env file at the root directory of your application and add the variables to it.

    // contents of .env 

    REACT_APP_API_KEY = 'my-secret-api-key'
*Finally, add .env to your .gitignore file so that Git ignores it and it never ends up on GitHub.
If you are using create-react-app then you only need step 3 and 4 but keep in mind variable needs to start with REACT_APP_ 
or it to work.

NOTE - Need to restart application after adding variable in .env file.
